          Experience the breathtaking beauty of the Ribeira Sacra region, known for its steep 
          vineyard terraces that have been cultivated since Roman times. This spectacular trail 
          runs along the dramatic canyons of the Sil and Mi√±o rivers, through ancient monasteries 
          and historic wine regions in the heart of Galicia.

        <p className="text-lg">
          The trail winds through lush forests, traditional stone villages, and alongside the iconic 
          terraced vineyards that cling to the steep canyon walls. With a challenging elevation gain of 
          3,450 D+, this course will test your endurance while rewarding you with spectacular views. 
          Our Trail Squad running coach and physiotherapist will be there to support you throughout the journey,
          from pre-race preparation to post-race recovery. Join us for optional social activities, including 
          a light communal run the day before the race to familiarize yourself with the terrain, and celebrate 
          your achievement with a well-deserved post-race drink with your fellow runners.
